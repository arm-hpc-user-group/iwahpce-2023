#  International Workshop on Arm-based HPC: Practice and Experience (IWAHPCE-2023)

<!-- IWAHPCE-2022: https://arm-hpc-user-group.github.io/iwahpce-2022/ -->
to be held in conjunction with The International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region ([HPC Asia 2023](https://www.sc-asia.org/hpc-asia-2023/)), Singapore, Feb 27 - March 2, 2023 


### Workshop Overview
This workshop aims to provide the opportunity to share the practice and experience of high-performance computing systems using the Arm architecture and their performance and applications.The last few years have seen an explosion of 64-bit Arm-based processors targeted toward server and infrastructure workloads, often specializing in a specific domain such as HPC, cloud, and machine learning. Fujitsu's A64FX and Marvell's ThunderX2 have been used in several large-scale HPC systems, and Amazon's Graviton2 has been adopted by Amazon EC2. Moreover, Amazon's Graviton3, NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, and SiPearl's Rhea system-on-chip are recently announced or become accessible.Sharing the practice and experiences using these Arm-based processors will contribute to advancing high-performance computing technology for newly designed systems using these new emerging Arm-based processors.

This workshop is a proceedings-based workshop that is closely related to the series of workshops organized at ISC, SC and the Arm Research Summit by groups like the [Arm HPC User Group (AHUG)](https://a-hug.org/).

In this workshop, we invite papers on the practice and experience of the Arm-based high-performance computing systems, if available, optimization and performance analysis of high-performance workloads for this new generation of Arm-based processors. We welcome performance optimization studies either through access to real hardware or via simulation/emulation frameworks.

### Topics
In particular, this workshop will focus on the following topics of interest:

- HPC Applications
- Performance Analysis, Performance Modeling & Measurement
- SVE Vectorization analysis
- Programming Models & System Softoware
- Networking and accelerators such as GPUs
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Emerging Technologies

### Paper Submissions

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:

- Full papers Manuscripts must be at most 18 pages in PDF format including figures and references
- Short papers Manuscripts must be at most 10 pages in PDF format including figures and references
- The paper format is described in the “Paper Submission” section of HPCAsia2023"

Please note that the paper format for the submission (one-column) is different from the one of the camera ready (2-column). Fore more detail, please refer https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions 

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the PC members. Papers will be accepted to presentations in a workshop. The review process is double-blind.

## HPC Asia 2023 (HPCA23) & SupercomputingAsia 2023 (SCA23) together in Singapore!
The International Conference on High Performance Computing in the Asia-Pacific Region (HPC Asia) is an international conference series for the Asia Pacific region on HPC technologies that fosters exchange of ideas, research results and case studies related to all issues of HPC. For the first time ever, HPC Asia 2023 will be co-located with the SupercomputingAsia 2023 (SCA23) conference in Singapore, from 27 February - 2 March 2023.

The SCA event is a major supercomputing conference in Asia, co-organised by supercomputing centres of the region including those in Australia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand and anchored by the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) Singapore. It incorporates a number of important supercomputing and allied events that together aim to promote a vibrant and shared high-performance computing (HPC) ecosystem, for both the public and private sectors, in Asia. For more information about the co-located HPCA23 and SCA23 conference, please visit www.sc-asia.org.
